In January of 2018, we released a preview version of our Go API. During that time we've made extensive changes to our Python API. As yet, those changes haven't made it into our Go API. If you are interested in using the Go API. drop us a line at [hello@wallaroolabs.com](mailto:hello@wallaroolabs.com) and we'll get you a copy of the documentation.
