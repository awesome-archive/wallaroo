In order to write a Wallaroo application in Pony, the developer creates the classes and functions (provided by [the Wallaroo API](/pony-tutorial/api/)) to be run at each stage of their application, along with an entry point called `Main`.

For a basic overview of what Wallaroo does, read [What is Wallaroo](/) and [Core Concepts](/core-concepts/). These documents will help you understand the system at a high level so that you can see how the pieces of the Pony API fit into it.


## Pony Packages

Wallaroo programs that use the Pony API can use any packages that would be used with a normal Pony program, including your own packages and third party packages. In order to use them, add them as you normally would using [Pony Stable](https://github.com/ponylang/pony-stable).

## Next Steps

If you haven't already done so, set up your environment for writing and running Wallaroo Pony application, refer to [our installation instructions](/pony-installation/). Otherwise, [onwards into the tutorial](/pony-tutorial/running-a-wallaroo-application/).
