In this section, we're going to review how you can start a new shell for Wallaroo regardless of how you installed it.

## Wallaroo in Docker

For each Shell you're expected to setup, you'd have to run the following to enter the Wallaroo Docker container:

Enter the Wallaroo Docker container:

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="Python 2.7" codelang="bash" >}}
docker exec -it wally env-setup
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Python 3" codelang="bash" >}}
docker exec -it wally env-setup -p python3
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}


This command will start a new Bash shell within the container, which will run the `env-setup` script to ensure our persistent Python `virtualenv` is set up.

If your Wallaroo docker container isn't set up or running, you'll get an error with the above command. Please see [Setting Up Your Environment for Wallaroo in Docker](/python-installation/python-docker-installation-guide/) for details on how to set up and start your Wallaroo Docker enviroment.

## Wallaroo in Vagrant

For each Shell you're expected to setup, you'd have to run the following to access the Vagrant Box:

```bash
cd ~/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo-{{% wallaroo-version %}}/vagrant
vagrant ssh
```

If your Wallaroo vagrant box isn't set up or running, you'll get an error with the above command. Please see [Setting Up Your Environment for Wallaroo in Vagrant](/python-installation/python-vagrant-installation-guide/) for details on how to set up and start your Wallaroo Vagrant enviroment.

## Wallaroo from source and Wallaroo Up

For each Shell you're expected to setup, you'd have to run the following to configure the Wallaroo environment:

```bash
cd ~/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo-{{% wallaroo-version %}}
source bin/activate
```

This command will set up the environment variables for running Wallaroo Applications.
